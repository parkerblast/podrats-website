            <summary>Why should I register my Elephalgo?</summary>
            <p class="text">By registering you will get the "/flex" command! This allows you to flex your Elephalgos in the #flex-your-elephalgos channel! This command also gives a link to the NFT Explorer and Rand Gallery page!</p>

        <details>
            <summary>Why do I need to opt-in?</summary>
            <p class="text">Doing this allows the bot to verify that you own the wallet, since only the wallets owner can opt-in to assets. This prevents someone from stealing your wallet and using it to get access to discord bot features. So, while it might be a bit more tedious, it is worth it!</p>
